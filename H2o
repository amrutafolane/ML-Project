H2O is an open-source, fast, scalable and all around wonderful platform for machine learning. It is Java-based but it has an R interface which I use for the Pump it Up competition. (The caret package is great as well and it contains more models for prediction.)


H2O is optimized for doing “in memory” processing of distributed, parallel machine learning algorithms

H20 along with data.table can be used to run parallel algorithms on large datasets.
